Studio Code, Git and GitHub, and a WRDS class count for this course.
- [**Various Method of Interacting with Python**](./01_methods_for_using_python.md): Throughout the course, we'll
discuss the various ways of interacting with Python: Google Collab, Jupyter
Notebooks through the standard Jupyter server, Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code,
using IPython in the command line, and running Python scripts directly from the
command line (`.py` files).
- **Individual Help with Setup.** Save 30-45 minutes at the end to help students individually with their setup.

## Homework
