# 3. Agenda

- **Questions about HW2?**
- **Overview of Pandas** As aspiring quantitative finance professionals, Pandas is likely the most important Python package you will use. It is a powerful data manipulation library that is built on top of Numpy. It is especially useful for working with time series data. We will go over the basics of Pandas and then work through a series of exercises to practice using Pandas. I'll skim through some introductory material from [Python Data Science Handbook](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/) by Jake VanderPlas.
